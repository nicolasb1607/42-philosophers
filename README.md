# Project Philosophers

## Introduction

Philosophy (from Greek, philosophia, literally "love of wisdom") is the study of general and fundamental questions about existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language. Such questions are often posed as problems to be studied or resolved. The term was probably coined by Pythagoras (c. 570 – 495 BCE). Philosophical methods include questioning, critical discussion, rational argument, and systematic presentation.

Classic philosophical questions include: Is it possible to know anything and to prove it? What is most real? Philosophers also pose more practical and concrete questions such as: Is there a best way to live? Is it better to be just or unjust (if one can get away with it)? Do humans have free will?

Historically, "philosophy" encompassed any body of knowledge. From the time of Ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle to the 19th century, "natural philosophy" encompassed astronomy, medicine, and physics. For example, Newton’s 1687 Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy later became classified as a book of physics.

In the 19th century, the growth of modern research universities led academic philosophy and other disciplines to professionalize and specialize. In the modern era, some investigations that were traditionally part of philosophy became separate academic disciplines, including psychology, sociology, linguistics, and economics.

Other investigations closely related to art, science, politics, or other pursuits remained part of philosophy. For example, is beauty objective or subjective? Are there many scientific methods or just one? Is political utopia a hopeful dream or hopeless fantasy?

Major sub-fields of academic philosophy include metaphysics ("concerned with the fundamental nature of reality and being"), epistemology (about the "nature and grounds of knowledge [and]... its limits and validity"), ethics, aesthetics, political philosophy, logic and philosophy of science.

## Common Instructions

Before diving into the project details, let's review some common instructions that apply to this project:

- **Language**: Your project must be written in C.

- **Norm Compliance**: Your project must adhere to the Norm. Norm errors, including those in bonus files/functions, will result in a score of 0.

- **Stability**: Your functions should not quit unexpectedly (e.g., segmentation fault, bus error, double free) apart from undefined behaviors. Unexpected crashes will lead to a non-functional evaluation.

- **Memory Management**: Properly free all heap allocated memory space. No leaks will be tolerated.

- **Makefile**: If required by the subject, include a Makefile to compile your source files with the flags -Wall, -Wextra, and -Werror using cc. Ensure your Makefile does not relink and includes the rules $(NAME), all, clean, fclean, and re.

- **Bonuses**: If applicable, create a bonus rule in your Makefile to include headers, libraries, or functions forbidden in the main part of the project. Store bonus code in separate _bonus.{c/h} files.

- **Libft Integration**: If permitted, integrate your libft by copying its sources and associated Makefile into a libft folder with its own Makefile. Your project’s Makefile should compile the library via its Makefile, then compile the project.

- **Testing**: Develop test programs for your project, although they won't be submitted or graded. These tests will assist in verifying your work and evaluating your peers' work during the defense.

- **Submission**: Submit your work to your assigned git repository. Deepthought may grade your work after peer evaluations, and any errors during Deepthought’s grading will halt the evaluation.
